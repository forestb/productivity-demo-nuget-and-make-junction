# Introduction

A local NuGet feed can speed development when making changes to libraries and referencing those changes in dependent projects.  

Project output directories can be added as local feeds themselves, but NuGet gets fussy when root directories, configured as local NuGet feeds, don't exist. 

By creating symbolic links to various packages, you get to avoid that fussy nature, and you only need to configure a single local NuGet feed - as opposed to adding every project as it's own feed.

# Usage
It's recommended to place the following function in your Powershell `$PROFILE` to ensure the `Make-Junction` command is available from your shell.

```powershell
# Create a symbolic link between the current working directory and the target directory
function Make-Junction([string]$target) {
  New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path $target -Value (Get-Item -Path ".\").FullName
}
```

# Example(s)
The example below assumes you have a folder `C:\nuget` configured as your local NuGet feed.

## Add the LevelUp C# SDK NuGet packages to your local NuGet feed
This example assumes the LevelUp C# SDK exists at `C:\Projects\LevelUp\levelup-sdk-csharp\`.

Building the project results in NuGet packages available at `C:\Projects\LevelUp\levelup-sdk-csharp\artifacts\`.

Create the symbolic link, adding the project output to your local NuGet feed:

```powershell
C:\Projects\LevelUp\levelup-sdk-csharp\artifacts > Make-Junction "C:\nuget\levelup-sdk-csharp"
```
